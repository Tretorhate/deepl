BIAS-VARIANCE TRADEOFF: COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS

THEORETICAL BACKGROUND:
The generalization error (test error) can be decomposed into three components:
  Error = Bias² + Variance + Irreducible Error

- Bias: Error from overly simplistic models (underfitting)
- Variance: Sensitivity of predictions to fluctuations in training data (overfitting)
- Irreducible Error: Fundamental noise in the data

THE TRADEOFF:
As model complexity increases:
  1. Bias decreases (model captures more patterns)
  2. Variance increases (model becomes more sensitive to training noise)
  3. Test error follows a U-shaped curve with an optimal complexity

EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATIONS:

1. LOW COMPLEXITY (Degree 1-3):
   - High training error (high bias)
   - High test error (still high bias)
   - Generalization gap is small (low variance)
   - Model cannot learn the true underlying function

2. MEDIUM COMPLEXITY (Degree 4-7) - OPTIMAL REGION:
   - Decreasing training error (lower bias)
   - Minimal test error (balanced bias-variance)
   - Small generalization gap (controlled variance)
   - Model captures essential patterns without memorizing noise

   Optimal Degree: 1
   Test MSE: 5.0485

3. HIGH COMPLEXITY (Degree 10-20):
   - Very low training error (low bias)
   - High test error (high variance dominates)
   - Large generalization gap (overfitting)
   - Model memorizes training noise and fails on new data

IMPLICATIONS FOR DEEP LEARNING:

1. Model Selection: Choose complexity that minimizes test error, not training error
2. Regularization: Use techniques like L2 regularization, dropout to reduce variance
3. Early Stopping: Monitor validation error to detect when variance increases
4. More Data: Larger training sets can reduce overfitting impact
5. Ensemble Methods: Combine multiple models to reduce variance
6. Feature Selection: Use fewer, more meaningful features to reduce complexity

PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATION:
Always use a validation set to monitor generalization. Select the model that
performs best on the validation set, not the one with lowest training error.
The optimal model balances learning the true underlying pattern while avoiding
memorization of training noise.
